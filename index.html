				<p>I took a road trip to take a girl from a camp in Texas to her home in Iowa. Her parents (friends) threw out the idea, and I took them up on it. I was so glad that I did. I got to hang out with a fascinating girl who fills her free time not with phone time and social networks but with pen, inks, pencils, etc.</p>
				<p>She drew when she was at my house with her feet petting the dogs. She drew in the car as we drove up and chatted. For her, the phone is a way for her to get images to draw. I was fascinated by her skill. She drew this dragonfly in two days while I was at her house in Iowa. I asked her permission to use it for my return to 100 Days of Code. </p>
				<p>Follow Tevka's instructions. She will tell you when you can click again. She's strict that way.</p>
